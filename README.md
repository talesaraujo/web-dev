# Web Dev

This repo is meant to store my simple web pages and applications on which I worked on during the Web Applications Development course hold by UFC. The course is based on the ME_N stack, i.e., the following technologies are applied:

* Clientside
  * HTML - CSS - JS - Bootstrap
  * Vue/ReactJS
* Serverside
  * NodeJS
  * ExpressJS 
* Database
  * MongoDB
